    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <h3>Analysis becomes insight</h3>
    <p style="width:600px;">
        Through strategic analysis and research the middle brain gains insight into brands, products, market trends, target audience, and competitors, with the goal of finding opportunities beyond the expected and familiar. The phase is ended with the development of a creative brief that pinpoints the client&#8217;s objective, target audience, and suggested strategy.<br/>

        - Research<br/>
        - Digital Brand strategy<br/>
        - Social consultation<br/>
        - Creative Brief development
    </p>    <h2 id="conception" class="h2title">Conception and Design</h2>    <h3>Insight becomes ideas</h3>      <p style="width:600px;">        Here is where a range of concepts come to life that fully address the clients&#8217; challenges, goals, and needs. 
        The concepts are reviewed, tested, refined, and crafted into the appropriate platform and form. <br/>

        - Concepts development and creation<br/>
        - Creative direction &amp; design.<br/>
        - UX: Spec Document, Site Map, Wire-Frames <br/>
        - Copy<br/>

    </p>        <h2 id="delivery" class="h2title">Delivery</h2>     <h3>Ideas become reality</h3>     <p style="width:600px;">        In this phase we specify, document, and deliver project details to the client for implementation, or we get directly involved in the production process. Both guarantee the accurate translation of goals and ideas originally specified on the creative brief into reality.<br/>

        - Style Guides (in the case of a website).<br/>
        - Programming. (We collaborate with a network of programmers, which allows the best fit for each project)<br/>
        - QA<br/>
        - Creating a framework that allows flexibility in future changes and improvements seamlessly and cost effectively

    </p>        <h2 id="support" class="h2title">Support</h2>      <h3>Reality is ever changing</h3>    <p style="width:600px;">After the project is up and running, we follow up to analyze how it performs to make adjustment, 
and to suggest new opportunities.<br/>
We provide ongoing support to further improve and upgrade the project in consideration for new technologies, marketing, and market trends.
